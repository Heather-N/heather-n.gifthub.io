            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Most of Utah was settled by members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, and Springville was no different. As a large number settled in what is now Salt Lake City, a small group was sent by Brigham Young to settle in what is now Springville. They arrived on September 18, 1850.</p>
            <p>The area had been named Hobble Creek a year earlier when an exploration team lost a pair of iron hobbles from one of their horses. The town steadily grew, however, and the name was changed to Springville as we all know it. On February 13, 1853, the town was officially incorporated.</p>
